Description 
=============

Binary left shift and Binary right shift. The shift  operators in python are a pair of digraphs << and >>, clearly suggesting in which direction the shift will act. Click [here](https://github.com/Fran0616/binaryShift/blob/master/binaryShift.py) to view the code

Code Analysis 
===============

**Variables**

varRight -  will move up to one value so the one will become 2 and divide var by 2. Shifting to the right by one bit is the same as interger division by two.

varLeftt - will 2 numbers up so two will turn to four and will multiply var by 4 which will be 17. Shifting to the left by two bits is the same as interger multiplication by four. 

Test Data

Expected Output:

17 68 8
